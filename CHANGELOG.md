# v2.0.0
### Updated to support .net 5.0
Updated a few things, unfortunately it removed a little bit of functionality, so it counts as a major update, 
even tho it's really quite a minor update.
- Updated projects to support and target .net Framework 5.0, and remove targets for frameworks that are no longer supported
by Microsoft.
- Updated reference for ProphetsWay.BaseDataAccess to v2.0.0


# v1.0.1
Updated reference for ProphetsWay.BaseDataAccess to v1.1.0, and now the DataAccess and Tests projects

# v1.0.0
### Initial proper release.  
Implements all the structural components to help illustrate how to best build a DAL that is based off the 
[ProphetsWay.BaseDataAccess](https://github.com/ProphetManX/ProphetsWay.BaseDataAccess) defined paradigm.
